# Bogus CV Generator

The Bogus CV Generator is a tool that generates multiple real-world CVs with different information each time, using the Bogus and OpenAI APIs. It's designed to aid with the creation of test data and offers customization options. The project is open source, and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

Before using the Bogus CV Generator, make sure you take the following steps:

1. Enter the App config Bogus-CV-Gen.dll and populate the API key with your own OpenAI API key. See this: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key
If you do not have an OpenAI API key for any reason you can set testmode to true on Appconfig however this will be limited to just one set of informationj for cv generation.
2. If desired, you can change the file directories used in the app, but we recommend using the default settings.
3. Follow the CV generation steps, once completed navigate to the CV folder and you will find the generated word documents.
4. For more customisability there are further settings that can be edited in the config file.

## Usage

To generate a CV, simply run the console application and follow the prompts. You can specify custom information or let the application generate random data for you. You can also specify the format of the information that's written to the CV and the template. The current recommended template is template 1.
